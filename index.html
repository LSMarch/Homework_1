        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Libby! I'm new to coding and really excited to get started on a new path!
            For a lot of years I have worked in the quick service food industry at various levels,
            from team member to general manager, I've seen it all. I left the industry to work for USPS.
            It was definitly a change of pace. After working that for several months I realized I needed a change,
            the monotony of it was disheartening. I started dabbling in coding, did some career research, asked a friend,
            and here I am! It is a hard pivot from what I'm used to, but I'm interested to see where coding will take me!

        <p>I have two cats who will undoubtedly make an appearnace at some point. My best friend rescued them,
            decided to foster them, and I was left with the task of nursing them back to health. And I kept them.
            The gray one is Ty, and the dark tortise shell is Bo. I call them BoTy when they're being cute,
            and TyBo when they're rambunctious. 
        </p>

            Coffee is my poison of choice, water is a far second. Sci-fi is my passion, books are my escape,
            music never stops, and puns give me life.
